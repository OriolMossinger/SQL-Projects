# SQL Projects Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my `SQL-Projects` repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing my SQL skills through various projects developed during my university course on Database and Data Warehousing. Each project within this repository demonstrates my ability to design, create, and manipulate SQL databases to solve real-world problems and provide insights through data analysis.

## Projects List

### Database Design for Industria del Cubito

This project involves creating a comprehensive database schema for Industria del Cubito, a company needing a database to manage fuel supply transactions. Key components include tables for vehicles (`tb_cars`), gas stations (`tb_gas_station`), fuel pricing (`tb_fuel_price`), refueling records (`tb_refueling`), invoices (`tb_invoice`), and line items in invoices (`tb_lines_invoice`). This project demonstrates database design, normalization, and SQL scripting.

### Data Manipulation and Analysis

- **Vehicles of Delivery:** Query to list delivery vehicles, including registration, model, employee, and registration date, ordered by registration date. 
- **Refueling in August 2022:** Analysis of refueling transactions in August 2022, focusing on those with exactly 41 liters, including the employee's name, vehicle model, gas station name, and date of refueling.
- **Total Liters Consumed by Commercial Vehicles:** A summary report of the total liters consumed by commercial vehicles, showcasing aggregate functions and group by clauses.

### Advanced SQL Queries

- **Analysis of 'VITO' Model Vehicles:** Comparative analysis of average fuel costs for 'VITO' model vehicles against the average of all delivery vehicles for September 2022.
- **Refueling Without Kilometer Reporting:** Identification of refueling instances where the vehicle's kilometers were not reported, specifically in selected gas stations.
